## spring-cli

The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that can be used if you want to 
quickly prototype with Spring. It allows you to run Groovy scripts, which means
that you have a familiar Java-like syntax, without so much boilerplate code.

For the command line help try:

    $ spring --help

or alternatively check [Spring Boot Reference Guide](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).
