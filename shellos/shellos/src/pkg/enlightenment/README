INSTALL NOTES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most incredible and really unbelievable dream has become true:
You compiled e17 successfully!

Starting e17:
Create a file ~/.xsession with the line 'exec /opt/e17/bin/enlightenment_start'.
Add a link to this file using 'ln -s ~/.xsession ~/.xinitrc'.

If you're using a login manager (GDM/KDM), select the session type 'default' in them.
If you're using the startx command, simply execute it now.

Note: e17 is still not released and it won't be in the near future. So don't
ask for a stable release. e17 is still very buggy and only for experienced users
who know what they do...

Rasterman didn't write this script so don't ask him for help with it.

Hint: From now on you can easily keep your installation up to date.
Simply run easy_e17.sh with -u instead of -i .

We hope you will enjoy your trip into e17... Have fun!
