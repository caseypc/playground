  SmartSprites maintains CSS sprites in your designs, fully automatically. No tedious 
  copying and pasting to your CSS when adding or changing sprited images. SmartSprites
  is meant mainly as a command-line tool, if you'd like to use its Java API,
  the {@link org.carrot2.labs.smartsprites.SpriteBuilder} class is the place to start.
