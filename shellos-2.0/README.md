shellos
=======

**ShellOS** is a set of scripts and applications to add functionality to Linux operating system for extended shell scripting and to create highly customisable hosting environment. It is dedicated to the Ubuntu distribution but most parts of it should work fine with any Debian based distro.

This project is inspired by [Beyond Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/ "Beyond Linux From Scratch") and [Rootnode](https://github.com/rootnode "Rootnode").

Why have I published the source? Because I don't think you can do both hack it and make much damages to my infrastructure without a zero-day exploit. However, if you're skilled enough you probably wouldn't need to see the source and wouldn't be interested in it anyway as there are better targets out there... Sounds like an invitation, doesn't it?
